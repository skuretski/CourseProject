If you have\nbeen doing that since you were\nborn that is 52,560 at the high\nside of that average. That\nnumber resembling nowhere\nnear a million had to have been\nconfigured by a dim-witted\nmoron. You would have to be\natleast 342 years old peeing 8\ntimes a day to pee a million\ntimes or pee 34 times a day\nand live to 80.\nDelivered\nA\niMessage\n", "file_name": "5jlwgs.jpg", "id": "5jlwgs"}
